The PCIe interface. This is mainly generated by QSys, but there are significant differences between
device families (Cyclone V, Stratix V, etc), so each family has its own subdirectory. There is also
a tlp-xcvr subdirectory which implements a TLP transceiver (i.e a state-machine that can send and
receive TLP messages over the bus).
