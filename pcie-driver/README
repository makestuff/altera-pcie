The Linux driver implements a couple of ioctl()s to initialize and control things, but the bulk of
the real work happens in userspace, so the driver just implements mmap(). Note that it receives
definitions of the queue sizes, etc from a defs.h file which is generated from a defs.vh file
located in the application directory (i.e under "apps"). So before you can build the driver, you
must go there and (at the very least) run "make defs".
